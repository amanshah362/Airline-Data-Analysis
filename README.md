# ✈ Airline Flight Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores and visualizes airline flight data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to **clean, analyze, and visualize** patterns in ticket prices, flight durations, routes, and airline market share.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains airline flight information including:
- **Airline**
- **Source City**
- **Destination City**
- **Price**
- **Duration**
- **Class** (Economy/Business)
- **Stops**
- **Days Left** before departure
- **Flight Number**
- **Arrival Time**

## 🔍 Key Steps & Analysis
### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Converted columns to numeric types
- Detected outliers using **IQR method**

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Average ticket price by airline
- Average flight duration by airline
- Price variation based on days left before departure
- Economy vs. Business class price comparison
- Popular source–destination city pairs
- Impact of number of stops on price and duration
- Airline market share calculation

## 📊 Visualizations
The following plots were created:
1. **Average Ticket Price by Airlines** (Bar chart)
2. **Ticket Price vs Days Left Before Departure** (Horizontal bar chart)
3. **Average Flight Duration by Airlines** (Bar chart)
4. **Market Share by Flight Count** (Pie chart)
5. **Price vs Stops** (Box plot)
6. **Airline Dominance on Routes** (Stacked bar chart)
7. **Most Popular City Pairs** (Bar chart)
8. **Economy vs Business Class Price** (Pie chart)
